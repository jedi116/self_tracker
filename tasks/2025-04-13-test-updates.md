# Test Updates (2025-04-13)

## Unit Test Improvements

### Fixed Unit Test Implementation

- Updated existing unit tests to properly test the actual components
- Refactored tests to follow best practices:
  - Test real components, not mock versions
  - Mock only necessary dependencies (not the components themselves)
  - Properly test component behavior and user interactions
  - Use consistent imports across test files

### Tests Updated

1. **Home Page Test (`src/tests/app/page.test.tsx`)**
   - Now tests the actual Home component
   - Added proper mocking for next-auth, navigation, and auth context
   - Tests both authenticated and non-authenticated states
   - Verifies content rendering and button click navigation

2. **Dashboard Page Test (`src/tests/app/dashboard/page.test.tsx`)**
   - Tests the actual Dashboard component
   - Properly mocks the auth hooks
   - Verifies all features from the real features array are rendered
   - Tests quote section and welcome message rendering

3. **FeatureCard Component Test (`src/tests/app/dashboard/featureCard.test.tsx`)**
   - Tests the actual FeatureCard component with provided props
   - Verifies title, description, and icon rendering
   - Tests navigation when card is clicked
   - Checks priority display

4. **HeroSection Component Test (`src/tests/components/landing/heroSection.test.tsx`)**
   - Tests the actual HeroSection component
   - Verifies image rendering with correct attributes
   - Tests hero name rendering

### Testing Best Practices Documented

Created a comprehensive testing lessons document (`tasks/testing-lessons.md`) that outlines:
- Proper approach to testing React components
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Best practices for testing Next.js applications
- Example code for proper test structure

## Next Steps

- Add tests for workout pages and forms
- Add tests for API routes
- Implement integration tests for core workflows
- Consider adding end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress

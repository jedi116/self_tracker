# Tasks Tracking

This file serves as the main index for tracking tasks and features in the Kaizen self-improvement application.

## Task Files (Chronological)

- [2024-04-13.md](./2024-04-13.md) - Initial features documentation
- [2025-04-13-test-updates.md](./2025-04-13-test-updates.md) - Unit test improvements
- [2025-04-13-sonar-integration.md](./2025-04-13-sonar-integration.md) - SonarCloud integration
- [2025-04-13-sonar-fixes.md](./2025-04-13-sonar-fixes.md) - SonarCloud issue fixes

## How to Use

At the beginning of each Claude Code session, reference this directory to provide context on:

- Previously implemented features
- Current project state
- Planned enhancements

Files are organized by date (YYYY-MM-DD[-description].md) to maintain chronological history of development.

## Naming Convention

Task files should follow this naming pattern:

- Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Include the date at the beginning (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Add a brief hyphenated description of the task/feature
- Use lowercase for the description part

Example: `2025-04-13-test-updates.md`

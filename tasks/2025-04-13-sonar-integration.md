# SonarCloud Integration (2025-04-13)

## Overview

Added SonarCloud integration to improve code quality monitoring and ensure consistent code standards across the project.

## Implemented Features

### SonarCloud Configuration

- Updated `sonar-project.properties` with proper configuration:
  - Set correct project information and version
  - Configured source and test paths
  - Set up exclusions for irrelevant files
  - Added coverage configuration
  - Specified TypeScript configuration path

### Test Coverage Integration

- Updated Jest configuration to generate coverage reports:
  - Enabled coverage collection
  - Set up LCOV report generation for SonarCloud
  - Configured coverage exclusions for test files and configs
  - Added `collectCoverageFrom` to specify which files to include

### CI/CD Integration

- Created GitHub Actions workflow for SonarCloud analysis:
  - Runs on main branch pushes and pull requests
  - Sets up Node.js environment
  - Runs tests with coverage
  - Submits results to SonarCloud

### Script Updates

- Added new npm scripts:
  - `test:coverage`: Runs tests with coverage reports
  - `sonar`: Runs tests with coverage and triggers Sonar analysis

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Quality Monitoring**:

   - Automatic detection of code smells and bugs
   - Early identification of potential issues
   - Consistent code standards enforcement

2. **Test Coverage Visibility**:

   - Clear metrics on test coverage percentage
   - Identification of untested code areas
   - Motivation to increase coverage

3. **Better Pull Request Reviews**:
   - Automated quality checks on PRs
   - Objective metrics for code quality
   - Reduced manual review burden

## Next Steps

1. Improve overall test coverage
2. Address any issues identified by SonarCloud
3. Set up quality gates and custom rules
4. Add SonarCloud badges to README
